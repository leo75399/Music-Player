00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:18.000
The club isn't the best place to find a lover

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.700
So the bar is where I go

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.900
Me and my friends at the table doing shots

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.700
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.100
You come over and start up a conversation with just me

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.500
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.700
Take my hand, stop

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.000
Put Van The Man on the jukebox

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.900
And then we start to dance

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.100
And now I'm singing like

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.300
Girl, you know I want your love

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.300
Your love was handmade for
somebody like me

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200
Come on now, follow my lead

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.400
I may be crazy, don't mind me

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.100
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.100
Come on now, follow my lead

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.100
I'm in love with the shape of you

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.600
We push and pull like a magnet do

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.200
Although my heart is falling too

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
I'm in love with your body

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000
And last night you were in my room

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
And now my bedsheets smell like you

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
Every day discovering something brand new

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.700
I'm in love with your body

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.100
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.800
I'm in love with your body

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.100
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
I'm in love with your body

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.100
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.700
I'm in love with your body

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.300
Every day discovering
something brand new

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.900
I'm in love with the shape of you

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.700
One week in we let the story begin

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.600
We're going out on our first date (mmmm)

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800
You and me are thrifty

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800
So go all you can eat

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.800
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.300
And how your family is doing okay

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.800
Tell the driver make the radio play

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And I'm singing like

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.100
Girl, you know I want your love

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.100
Come on now, follow my lead

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.400
I may be crazy, don't mind me

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.100
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.200
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.900
Come on now, follow my lead

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.800
Come, come on now, follow my lead

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.100
I'm in love with the shape of you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.600
We push and pull like a magnet do

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.000
Although my heart is falling too

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.600
I'm in love with your body

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
And last night you were in my room

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.000
And now my bedsheets smell like you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.500
Come on, be my baby, come on

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.900

Come on, be my baby, come on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.200
I'm in love with the shape of you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.700
We push and pull like a magnet do

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.100
Although my heart is falling too

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.700
