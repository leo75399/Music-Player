00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:18.700
We've been done long before it all begun

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.600
Still can't give it up

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.300
Lead me on but leave before the morning comes

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.850
Even though it's what we want, can't keep this up for long

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.600
But I just, I just don't wanna leave you

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.300
Might just, might just throw away the reasons

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Why we both can't lay here

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.300
And secret, secret, both gotta keep it

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.200
Honest, honest, that's just a game

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.450
We know we both can't play

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.800
For tonight, I'm yours

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.800
So deny the truth

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.800
We'll stay ****** closed doors

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.850
'Cause all I wanna do is lie with you

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.100
Even though it's wrong to lie with you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.800
We've become **** to what we know is wrong

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.700
But no one knows but us

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.600
The feelings rush every single time we touch

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.000
Even though it's what we want, can't keep this up for long

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.600
But I just, I just don't wanna leave you

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
Might just, might just throw away the reasons

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.300
Why we both can't lay here

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.300
And secret, secret, both gotta keep it

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.200
Honest, honest, that's just a game

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.800
We know (Know), we both can't play

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.700
For tonight, I'm yours (I'm yours)

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.500
So deny the truth (Deny the truth)

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.800
We'll stay ****** closed doors

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.000
'Cause all I wanna do is lie (Lie), with you

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.600
For tonight, I'm yours

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.300
So deny the truth

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.600
We'll stay ****** closed doors

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.750
'Cause all I wanna do is lie with you

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:12.000
Even though it's wrong, I'll lie with you
