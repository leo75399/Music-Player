00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.900
Please don't see

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.400
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.200
Please see me

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.700
Reaching out for someone I can see

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.400
Take my hand let’s see where we wake up tomorrow

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.500
Best laid plans sometimes it’s just a one night stand

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.300
I’ll be damned Cupid’s demanding back his arrow

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.100
So let’s get drunk on our tears and

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.200
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.000
It’s hunting season and the lambs are on the run

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.900
Searching for meaning

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:23.100
But are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Who are we?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.200
Just a spec of dust within the galaxy

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.600
Woe is me

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.100
If we’re not careful turns into reality

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.800
Don’t you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.700
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.100
Turn the page maybe we’ll find a brand new ending

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:14.100
Where we’re dancing in our tears

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.100
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.000
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.000
Searching for meaning

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.200
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.000
And I thought I saw you out there crying

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.800
And I thought I heard you call my name

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.500
And I thought I heard you out there crying

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.900
Just the same

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.800
And God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.700
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.400
Searching for meaning

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.600
But are we all lost stars trying to light ... light up the dark?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.600
And I thought I saw you out there crying

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.400
And I thought I heard you call my name

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.600
And I thought I heard you out there crying

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.800
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.600
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
