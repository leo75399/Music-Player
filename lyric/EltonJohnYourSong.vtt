00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.030
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.700
I'm not one of those who can easily hide

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.800
I don't have much money but boy if I did

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.580
I'd buy a big house where we both could live

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.600
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.420
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.320
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:11.750
My gift is my song and this one's for you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.900
And you can tell everybody this is your song

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.500
It may be quite simple but now that it's done

 00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.250
I hope you don't mind

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.740
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:54.180
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.390
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.610
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.910
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.310
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:33.290
So excuse me forgetting but these things I do

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:40.389
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:48.480
Anyway the thing is what I really mean

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.380
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.900
And you can tell everybody this is your song

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.120
It may be quite simple but now that it's done

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.060
I hope you don't mind

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.740
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:31.050
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.920
I hope you don't mind

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.690
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.690
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
