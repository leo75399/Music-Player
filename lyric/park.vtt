00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.500
I don't like my mind right now

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.800
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary

00:00:9.900 --> 00:00:12.900
Wish that I could slow things down

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.700
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000
And I drive myself crazy

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.600
Thinking everything's about me

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200
Yeah, I drive myself crazy

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.900
Cause I can't escape the gravity

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm holding on

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.550
Why is everything so heavy?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.300
Holding on

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200
So much more than I can carry

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.500
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.300
If I just let go, I'd be set free

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.200
Holding on

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.600
Why is everything so heavy?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
You say that I'm paranoid

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.900
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's not like I make the choice

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.200
To let my mind stay so ******* messy

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.300
I know I'm not the center of the universe

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.700
I know I'm not the center of the universe

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.100
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.100
I'm holding on

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.600
Why is everything so heavy?

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.400
Holding on

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500
So much more than I can carry

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.400
If I just let go, I'd be set free

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.400
Holding on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
Why is everything so heavy?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.700
I know I'm not the center of the universe

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.900
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.100
I know I'm not the center of the universe

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.200
And I drive myself crazy

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.100
Thinking everything's about me

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.700
Holding on

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.500
Why is everything so heavy?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.200
Holding on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.200
So much more than I can carry

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.400
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.300
If I just let go, I'd be set free

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.100
Holding on

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.100
Why is everything so heavy?

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.300
Why is everything so heavy?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.900
Why is everything so heavy?
